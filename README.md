2D Isometric RPG written in C#/XNA featuring 3 unique classes and multitides of abilities and enemies.

TODO:

(There is a more detailed TODO list in the 'entry' class)

- Swap out any borrowed art
- Finish implementing skills
- Fix the problems that come with the particle system being used for skills -- they cause frame rate issues
  due to improper use. (May need to implement my own particle system that works better with the isometric view)
- Use the level editor to design more levels. As of right now there are not very many.
